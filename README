#ROBOTCOORDINATOR

RobotCoordinator is a very simple Java sofware that simulates the coordinators of a Robot that lands on Mars.
 This software gets the coordinator of a robot that lands on Mars following some rules:
 F --> Moves Forward.
 L --> Moves to the left
 R --> Moves to the right.
 The main idea of this software is based on a Math Grid where there are the X, Y and cartesian 
 plain.
